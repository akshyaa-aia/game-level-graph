# 🎮 Level Design in Games Using Graphs

This project demonstrates how **graph theory** can be applied to video game level design.  
Using a web-based interactive graph editor, you can model **rooms (nodes)** and **pathways (edges)**, then analyze them with graph algorithms like **Topological Sort** and **Path Finding**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add nodes (rooms) and connect them with edges (paths).
- Switch between:
  - **Directed mode** → one-way progression (puzzles, prerequisites).
  - **Undirected mode** → two-way exploration (open-world).
- Analyze levels with:
  - **Topological Sort** (check ordering of rooms in Directed mode).
  - **Find Paths** (see all possible paths between Start and Boss).
- Export/Import graph layouts in JSON format.
- Auto layout and zoom/reset view options.
